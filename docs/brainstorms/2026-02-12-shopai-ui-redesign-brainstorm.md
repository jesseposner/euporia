# ShopAI UI Redesign Brainstorm

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Draft

## What We're Building

A multi-screen AI shopping concierge UI, upgrading euporia from a single full-screen chat to a polished multi-page app with three core screens:

1. **Conversational Concierge** — Chat interface with sidebar conversation history, rich product card recommendations, and quick-action suggestion chips
2. **Dashboard** — Overview with cart management and product browsing (adapted from the inventory/replenishment mockup, scoped to live Shopify data only)
3. **Product Detail** — Split-view product page with AI-generated review synthesis, pros/cons, personalization insights, and feature sentiment breakdown

The app adopts the **ShopAI brand** from the mockups, including Material Icons and the blue (#137fec) primary color scheme with dark mode as default.

## Why This Approach

The current euporia app is a single chat page. While functional, it doesn't showcase the AI concierge's capabilities visually. The three mockup screens provide a rich, app-like experience that demonstrates the product vision for a hackathon demo.

**Key constraints driving decisions:**

- **Single Shopify store for now** (store.bitcoinmagazine.com), but UI should be flexible enough to support multiple stores later
- **Live data only** — no mock data. Features like delivery tracking and AI replenishment detection are out of scope since they can't be backed by real Shopify data. The dashboard will focus on what Shopify MCP provides: product catalog, cart state, and AI-driven recommendations
- **AI-generated content** for review synthesis and pros/cons will come from Claude analyzing Shopify product descriptions, not from mock data

## Key Decisions

### Branding & Design System
- **Brand:** ShopAI (not euporia)
- **Icons:** Material Icons (switching from Lucide) -- note: this overrides the CLAUDE.md convention for this project
- **Colors:** Primary #137fec, dark mode default, matching mockup palette
- **Typography:** Inter font family
- **Component library:** Continue using shadcn/ui but style to match mockup aesthetic

### Navigation
- **Persistent sidebar** (like mockup 2) with icon+label nav links
- Routes: `/` (dashboard), `/chat` (conversational concierge), `/products/[handle]` (product detail)
- Sidebar collapses to icon-only on smaller screens

### Screen Adaptations (Live Data Only)

#### 1. Conversational Concierge (`/chat`)
- Keep existing chat functionality (Vercel AI SDK + Claude + Shopify MCP)
- **Add:** Sidebar with conversation history (stored in backend SQLite)
- **Add:** Rich product cards in AI responses (upgrade existing ProductCard)
- **Add:** Quick-action suggestion chips below AI responses
- **Add:** AI status indicator in header
- **Remove from mockup:** Nothing major — this screen maps well to live data

#### 2. Dashboard (`/`)
- **Keep from mockup:** Product browsing/search, cart summary panel
- **Adapt:** "Replenishment Needs" becomes "Recommended Products" — AI suggests products based on taste profile
- **Remove:** Delivery tracking (no live data source), multi-retailer grouping in cart (single store), inventory/pantry features
- **Add:** Quick access to recent chat sessions, featured/new products from Shopify catalog

#### 3. Product Detail (`/products/[handle]`)
- **Keep:** Split-view layout (images left, details right), image gallery with thumbnails
- **Keep:** AI Review Synthesis section — Claude generates pros/cons from product description and metadata
- **Adapt:** "How it fits your life" section uses the user's taste profile from the backend
- **Adapt:** Feature sentiment bars generated by AI based on product attributes
- **Remove:** User avatars/social proof (no data source), "Verified Authentic" badge
- **Keep:** Add to Cart with quantity selector, pricing display

### Data Architecture
- **Products:** Shopify Storefront MCP (`search_shop_catalog`, `get_product_details`)
- **Cart:** Shopify Storefront MCP (`update_cart`, `get_cart`)
- **Taste profiles:** Existing Rust backend (`/api/profiles/{session_id}`)
- **Chat history:** Backend SQLite (new conversations table) — persists across devices
- **AI insights (reviews, pros/cons):** Generated by Claude on first view, cached in backend SQLite

### Technical Approach
- Next.js App Router with layout containing the sidebar
- Shared layout component with sidebar nav across all routes
- Existing chat API route stays mostly unchanged
- New API route for AI product analysis (or extend chat route)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme matching mockup colors

## Resolved Questions

1. **Chat history persistence:** Backend SQLite database. Add a conversations table to persist chat history across devices.

2. **AI product analysis:** Cache in backend. Generate AI review synthesis on first product view, store in SQLite, serve from cache on subsequent views.

3. **Store configuration:** Keep hardcoded in .env for now. Multi-store UI is out of scope — just keep the data model flexible enough to add a store identifier later.
